Test Driven Development
Integers Addition 🧮
In 🐍's land, where numbers reside, Two integers unite, in an addition's stride. The function is crafted, with checks so tight, Exception raises when the inputs aren't right. 💥

Divide a Matrix 📊
In the matrix's realm, where numbers align, A division takes place, with precision in mind. Rows must be of equal size, and that's the clue, If not, exceptions rise, with messages so true. 💔

Say My Name 🗣️
Names are spoken, in 🐍's sweet tone, First and last, in a function well known. Strings they must be, no other shall pass, For 🐍 to say, your name with class. 🎙️

Print Square 🟦
🐍 prints squares, of any size you choose, But negative ones, it firmly refuses. An integer it wants, no floats allowed, Exception shouts if the rules aren't endowed. 🚫

Text Indentation 📝
Text with dots, question marks, and more, 🐍 adds new lines, as per the lore. Strings they must be, no errors allowed, 🐍's grace with text, it's all avowed. 🧴

Max Integer - Unittest 🧪
Unittests come forth, in this coding spree, For max integer, we test with glee. 🐍's power, in tests, we unleash, To ensure our function, will never breach. ✅

Matrix Multiplication 🧩
Matrices are multiplied, with precision so clear, 🐍's function handles, without any fear. Lists of integers, in arrays so neat, The result is a matrix, a masterpiece to meet. 🌟

Lazy Matrix Multiplication 🍃
Matrices are multiplied, with NumPy's grace, A library's power, in this 🐍's space. No errors allowed, all tests we endure, With NumPy's might, the code's allure. 🔄
